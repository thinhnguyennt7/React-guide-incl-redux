** In person.js file
const person = {
    name: 'Thinh'
}

export default person
// Note the default here is useful because when we import this func from another
// file then we can call it any name we want.
// for example: in line 18 and line 17, we import the person file with the diff name

** In utility.js file
export const clean = () => { ... }
export const baseData = 10;

// export here has no default

** In app.js file
import person from './person.js'
import pr from './person.js'

// These call name export
import { baseData } from './utility.js'
import { clean } from './utility.js'
// or do this import { smth as Smth } from './utlity.js'
// or if you want to import all the name do this: import * as bundled from './utlity.js'
